# Samsung S24 Ultra Debloat

Here are the [debloat list](s24_debloat_list.txt) I've made myself for my own use case, try it to get rid of a lot of useless software and improve your phone performance.

Personally I like to use [ADB AppControl](https://adbappcontrol.com/) for doing this, it's so easy and good experience, but you can also use the ADB CLI directly.

## Recommended process

So I did a backup of everything to be able to factory reset my phone, and here is the step-by-step guide:

1. Factory reset your phone
2. Do the initial setup only connecting to Wi-Fi and then skipping and rejecting everything
3. Login into your Samsung Account
4. Update your apps at Samsung Store (and search and install apps that are grey and bugged in apps menu)
5. Update your apps at PlayStore
6. Enable developer mode and use the unbloat list

That's it, now you're ready to make it sharper for your use cases.
