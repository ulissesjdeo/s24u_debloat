# Samsung S24 Ultra Debloat

Here are the [debloat list](s24_debloat_list.txt) I've made myself for my own use case, try it to get rid of a lot of useless software and improve your phone performance.

Personally I like to use [ADB AppControl](https://adbappcontrol.com/) for doing this, it's so easy and good experience, but you can also use the ADB CLI directly.
