# Samsung S24 Ultra Debloat

[Debloat list](s24_debloat_list.txt). It removes a lot of useless software and improves your phone performance.

I like to use [ADB AppControl](https://adbappcontrol.com/) for this, but you can also use the ADB CLI directly.

## Recommended process

So, I did a backup of everything to be able to factory reset my phone, and here is the step-by-step guide:

1. Factory reset your phone
2. Do the initial setup only connecting to Wi-Fi and then skipping and rejecting everything
3. Login into your Samsung Account
4. Update your apps at the Samsung Store (and search and install apps that are grey and bugged in the apps menu)
5. Update your apps at PlayStore
6. Enable developer mode and use the debloat list

That's it.

## FIX ME

Things I know are broken

- Smart View (Mirror Screen wirelessly)
- Samsung Dex wireless
- Remote storage (like usb-c ones)
